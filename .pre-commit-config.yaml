        # Due to the Ruff config we use (see comment in pyproject.yaml), it's possible that the
        # formatter creates linting failures. By only doing a check here, it forces the dev to run
        # the formatter before pre-commit runs (presumably on save through their editor) and then
        # the linting check above would always catch a problem created by the formatter.
